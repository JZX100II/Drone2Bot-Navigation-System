# üß≠ Drone & Robot Mapping and Navigation (NavSLAM System)

---

## üìò Overview

This project implements a **two-phase mapping and navigation system** that combines **SLAM**, **QR-based localization**, and **A\*** path planning.  

The project involves two main robots:
- üõ©Ô∏è **Mavic** ‚Äî used in *Phase 1* for precise environment mapping and QR scanning  
- ü§ñ **TurtleBot3** ‚Äî used in *Phase 2* for navigation **without GPS or compass**, relying only on camera, LiDAR, and QR codes

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 1 ‚Äî Mapping & QR Localization (Mavic)

**Goal:** Build a LiDAR-based map of a multi-room house and record all door QR code positions.

### Key Features
- Controlled the **Mavic robot** to explore a house with **6‚Äì7 rooms**.
- Each **door** contains a **QR code** with a unique number identifier.
- The controller scans all QR codes and records their:
  - Numeric ID
  - Detected 2D position
  - Orientation (if available)
- All data is stored in a structured **`qr_positions.json`** file.
- A **rotating LiDAR** was used to avoid rotating the Mavic body at each waypoint.
- **GPS and Compass** were allowed to ensure:
  - Accurate map construction  
  - High-precision QR code localization

### Outcome
At the end of Phase 1:
- A **LiDAR map** of the full house is generated.
- A **JSON file** stores every QR code‚Äôs global position.
- This map and data become the reference for Phase 2.

## üß≠ Phase 2 ‚Äî Autonomous Navigation (TurtleBot3)

**Goal:** Navigate between rooms **without GPS or Compass**, using only camera, LiDAR, and previously saved QR code data.

### Approach

1. **Initial Door Detection**
   - The TurtleBot rotates in place, scanning for a **specific color** that marks door frames.
   - Once the door color is found, the bot aligns itself by centering the color in the camera frame.

2. **QR Code Scan for Rough Localization**
   - As the TurtleBot moves toward the door, a QR code eventually enters view.
   - The code is scanned, and its ID is used to fetch the **door‚Äôs known position** from Phase 1.
   - This gives a **rough estimate of the bot‚Äôs initial position**.

3. **Pose Refinement**
   - When the QR code disappears from view, a **timer (‚âà4 seconds)** starts.
   - After the timer ends, the TurtleBot is assumed to be near the **door‚Äôs center**.
   - The bot‚Äôs position is then updated precisely to match the door‚Äôs recorded coordinates.
   - This yields a **3‚Äì4 cm localization accuracy** in most trials.

4. **Path Planning**
   - Using the refined position, the **A\*** algorithm plans a path from the current door to the target door.
   - The generated waypoints are followed sequentially until the goal door is reached.
